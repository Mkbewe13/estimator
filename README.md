A Laravel application for generating estimations of programming projects using large language models.

The premise of the application is as follows:
- Create a project description according to the template
- Receive estimates in xlsx format
- Send the estimates to the programmer who verifies them and applies any corrections to the xlsx file
- Send a quote to the client ;) 


Currently, this is the MVP version of the project.
